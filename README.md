# LIRI-Node-App
LIRI is a command-line node app that returns info on concerts, music and movies based on the user's input.

## Features
  * LIRI comes with four functions for the user
### Concert Search
  * The user enters the phrase "concert-this" and a singer or band he or she would like to see in concert.
  * LIRI returns information for up to 10 of the next concerts listed for the artist/band at bandsintown.com.
  * Information returned includes venue name, city, state/country, and date.
  * If no state is listed, LIRI returns the country instead.
